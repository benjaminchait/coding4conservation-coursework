Coding 4 Conservation is a year-long mentorship program in R-based data analysis and communication for Malagasy students with ongoing research projects in ecology, conservation, biodiversity science, and related fields which runs from May 2022 to April 2023.

We are pleased to announce our National Geographic-funded, year-long mentorship program _Coding for Conservation_. This program is targeted towards Malagasy students in their third cycle or higher in conservation biology, zoology, animal biodiversity, entomology, botany, and related fields, though all are welcome to apply. In part with this program, Malagasy students will attend a mix of remote (online) and in-person lectures and tutorials on an **every-other-week frequency** while also receiving **one-on-one instruction** in data analysis and scientific writing oriented towards the publication of their personal research projects. Funding will be provided for students to procure data to attend online workshops, and opportunities will be available for students based in Antananarivo to view lectures in a group setting.

Students will receive general instruction in the analysis and modeling of ecological data in a series of interactive lectures and computer-based tutorials using the open-source software R and learn to fine-tune research questions and develop clear analytical frameworks. Attendance and participation in all lessons and tutorials will be mandatory.

Additionally, students will be assigned a one-on-one instructor mentor to guide them personally in analysis and write-up of their own data over the course of the year, with the goal of submitting the work for eventual publication. We are specifically interested in selecting students with ongoing research projects and existing datasets who seek additional support in data analysis and writing a manuscript for publication. 

**Selected students have already been notified of their invitation to participation in the program.** Please review our tentative <a href="/syllabus">syllabus</a> for a tentative program plan. You will be invited to join a Google Calendar that includes links to these zoom meetings shortly. Please also review and complete all installations and tutorials on the <a href="/preparation">preparation</a> page prior to the onset of the workshop on June 13. We will have an open office hours day on Friday, June 13 if you have any questions or are struggling with any of the material.
